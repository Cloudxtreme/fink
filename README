fink is a Go playing AI that I wrote to compete in the Mindstab Go AI
competition of 2008 (https://danballard.com/ai-contest/wiki/Main_Page)
It was one of my first real Lisp programming projects.

It is pretty basic.  It maintains a board state model, and does a min
max search of the gamespace with simple scoring algorithms.  Since it
lacks pruning I think it only searchs to a depth of 1 or 2. :/
It's scoring is implemented in subclasses of the board class that all
add scores together.  The first module scores just for free space each 
stone has which promotes fink to make grids.  Then further modules added
object awareness to it and it tried to create objects with the most free
space, which promoted it to play one monolithic structure.  And I think
that was as far as I got before we folded the competition.

Enjoy
